* remove tdl, as it's deprecated, and switch to pure libtcod:
  https://github.com/libtcod/python-tcod

* move all CONSTANTS to a separate file (or yml ?)

* improve use of colors (roguecolors was good following the tutorial, but now, move to something simpler)
    * themes ? greyscale, high contrast for color impaired, dark, light ?

* generalize place_objects()
    * items and monsters definition should be in a separate 'configuration' file (yml)
    * 'for loop' handling items/monsters creation

* 'h' for help ?

* mouse menus ? (Tk, pySimpleGUI)

* A* pathfinding ? (for monsters)

* New items:
    * Potion of Vision (1/100): reveal all tiles/items/monsters of a map
    * Mimic (monster, 1/100): mimic something (item), weak attack (1), weak life (1)
